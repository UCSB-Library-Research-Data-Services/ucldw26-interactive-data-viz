# From Static to Dynamic: Exploring Interactive Data Visualizations 

## Workshop Description

Most of us are used to making figures that are meant to be read, not explored – plots designed for PDFs and journal pages. Interactive graphics open up new possibilities by letting viewers zoom in, filter, and engage with data in ways static figures cannot. In this session, we’ll explore what makes a visualization interactive, when it’s worth using, and how simple interactions can add insight. We’ll look at a few short examples using tools such as DataTables, Plotly, and Shiny. You will leave with practical tips on creating, sharing, and sustaining interactive graphics. 

*No prior experience with coding or interactive visualization is required.*
