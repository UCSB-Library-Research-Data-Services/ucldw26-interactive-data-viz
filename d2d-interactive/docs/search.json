    "text": "Interactive Apps with Shiny: Letting Users Shape the View\nDT and plotly allow viewers to explore a predefined view of the data, but the structure of the analysis, such as which park to display or how time is summarize, is still set in advance. Shiny extends interactivity by allowing uswers to make choices that actively change what is shown. In other words, viewers are no longer just interacting with a figure, they are shaping the analysis itself.\nRun the following line of code to launch the Shiny app we created for this workshop on your computer. This Shiny app lets you select different California National Parks and summarize visitation data using different time windows (e.g., 5-year, 10-year, or 20-year averages). As you interact with the app, consider the following questions:\n\nHow do seasonal visitation patterns differ between parks?\nHow does the apparent pattern change when you switch from 5-year to 20-year averages?\nWhich choices—park selection or time scale—have the biggest impact on what you see?\n\n\nshiny::runGitHub(\"ucldw26-interactive-data-viz\", \"UCSB-Library-Research-Data-Services\", subdir = \"d2d-shiny/\")\n\n\nShiny is especially useful when you want to support repeated, user-driven exploration or when different audiences may ask different questions of the same dataset. At the same time, it introduces additional complexity around design, hosting, and long-term maintenance (You will have noticed that we have decided not to host our National Park Shiny app). In many cases, an interactive table using DT or interactive plot using plotly may be sufficient; Shiny becomes most valuable when you want to give users control over the questions being asked."

As we have seen, interactive datatable, plotly, and shiny apps each support different kinds of interaction – ranging from transparent look up and comparison to pattern discovery and user-driven exploration. More interactivity is not always better; the most effective choice ultimately depends on your data, your audiences, and what you want viewers to be able to do. Being intentional about these choices helps ensure that interactive graphics add clarity and insights, rather than complexity for its own sake."
